TODO:
+ Add getJoints() on FBody
+ Check which properties can and which cannot be changed once added to the world (make it transparent to the user)
+ Add a getStaticBody()/getDynamicBody() to Revolute and Prismatic joints
  - Make GearJoint use the getDynamicBody()
+ Revolute and Prismatic (and maybe others) joints can both inherit from a BiBodyJoint
+ Optimize by avoid creation of extra Vec2 instances

DONE:
+ Use the ViewportTransform provided by jBox2D
+ Fix the tracking of Contacts
  - Keep copies of the contacts in the World
  - Handle contactresult
