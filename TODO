+ Check which properties can and which cannot be changed once added to the world
+ Add a getStaticBody()/getDynamicBody() to Revolute and Prismatic joints
  - Make GearJoint use the getDynamicBody()
+ Revolute and Prismatic (and maybe others) joints can both inherit from a BiBodyJoint
+ Use the ViewportTransform provided by jBox2D
+ Optimize by avoid creation of extra Vec2 instances
